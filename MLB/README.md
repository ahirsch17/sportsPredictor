## üéØ Key Differences from NFL

### 1. **Home Field Advantage is BIGGER in MLB**
- **NFL:** Standard +2.0, max +3.0 for dominant home teams
- **MLB:** Standard +2.0, up to **+3.5** for dominant home teams
- **Why:** Park dimensions, altitude (Coors Field), weather, and familiarity matter more in baseball

### 2. **Starting Pitcher is CRITICAL**
- **MLB Starting Pitcher Injury = +4.0 points** (vs +5.0 for NFL QB)
- Starting pitcher controls ~60% of the game
- One player (pitcher) affects both offense AND defense

### 3. **Recency Weighting is MORE Aggressive**
- **MLB:** Recent games weighted **~70%** (vs ~65% in NFL)
- **Why:** Baseball has 162 games vs 17 in NFL, so hot/cold streaks matter more

### 4. **Different Stats Tracked**

#### NFL Stats:
- Yards per play, passing/rushing yards
- Third down conversion
- Turnovers, sacks
- Points scored/allowed

#### MLB Stats:
- **Batting:** AVG, OBP, SLG, OPS, HR, Runs
- **Pitching:** Runs allowed, Hits allowed
- **Defense:** Errors
- Run differential

## üìä MLB-Specific Prediction Factors

### 1. **Batting vs Pitching Matchup** (0 to 3.0 pts)
**Formula:** `Team_OPS / (Opponent_Runs_Allowed / 4.5)`
- Strong advantage (>1.15 ratio): +3.0
- Moderate advantage (>1.05): +1.5
- Pitching dominates (<0.90): +2.0 to pitching team

**Why:** OPS (On-Base + Slugging) is the best single offensive metric

### 2. **Run Production** (0 to 2.0 pts)
- Team scoring >1.0 run/game more: +2.0
- Rewards consistent offensive output

### 3. **Power Hitting (HR)** (0 to 1.0 pts)
- Team hitting >0.5 HR/game more: +1.0
- Home runs are game-changers

### 4. **Recent Form** (0 to 2.0 pts)
**Last 10 games** (not 3 like NFL):
- ‚â•70% win rate: HOT (+2.0)
- ‚â•60% win rate: Momentum (+1.0)
- ‚â§30% win rate: Struggling (+1.5 to opponent)

**Why:** 162-game season means momentum matters, but streaks happen

### 5. **Home Field Advantage** (2.0 to 3.5 pts)
**Dynamic based on home/away splits:**
- Home advantage >20%: **+3.5** (DOMINANT)
- Home advantage >10%: **+2.5** (STRONG)
- Default: **+2.0** (Standard)

**MLB home advantage >NFL** due to:
- Park factors (dimensions, altitude)
- Travel fatigue (162 games)
- Familiarity with field
- Last at-bat advantage

### 6. **Win Rate Factor** (0 to 3.0 pts)
- Same as NFL: `Win_Rate √ó 3.0`
- Prevents circular logic

### 7. **Pythagorean Expectation** (+1.0 or -1.0)
**Formula:** `(Runs_Scored^1.83) / (Runs_Scored^1.83 + Runs_Allowed^1.83)`
- MLB uses **1.83 exponent** (vs 2.37 for NFL)
- Identifies over/underperforming teams

### 8. **Run Differential** (0 to 1.5 pts)
- Differential >1.0 run/game: +1.5
- Best indicator of team quality

### 9. **Injury Impact** (0 to 4.0 pts)
**Position Weights:**
- **Starting Pitcher: 12.0** (most critical)
- Relief Pitcher/Closer: 3.0
- Catcher: 3.5
- Infielders: 2.5-3.0
- Outfielders: 2.0

**Starting Pitcher Injury = +4.0** (massive impact)

## üÜö NFL vs MLB Comparison

| Factor | NFL | MLB |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **Most Important Position** | QB (10.0 weight) | SP (12.0 weight) |
| **Home Advantage** | +2.0 to +3.0 | **+2.0 to +3.5** |
| **Recent Form Window** | Last 3 games | **Last 10 games** |
| **Recency Weight** | ~65% recent | **~70% recent** |
| **Key Offensive Stat** | Yards/play | **OPS** |
| **Games Per Season** | 17 | **162** |
| **Pythagorean Exponent** | 2.37 | **1.83** |
| **Confidence Divisor** | 6 | **5** (baseball less predictable) |

---

## üìà Expected Accuracy

### MLB vs NFL Predictability:
- **NFL:** ~70-80% accuracy (with improvements)
- **MLB:** ~60-70% accuracy expected

**Why MLB is harder to predict:**
1. **Starting pitcher variability** - One player controls 60% of game
2. **162 games** - More randomness, hot/cold streaks
3. **Lower scoring** - Small sample size per game (5 runs vs 25 points)
4. **"Any given day"** - More upsets in baseball
5. **Bullpen unknown** - Late-game relief pitchers not tracked

---

## üöÄ Usage

### 1. Extract Historical Data:
```bash
cd MLB
python dataextract.py
```
**Note:** This will take **several minutes** (scans April-September)

### 2. Run Prediction:
```bash
python predictor.py
```
Enter team names when prompted (e.g., "New York Yankees", "Los Angeles Dodgers")

### 3. View Injury Report (Optional):
```bash
python injuryextract.py
```
Generates `injuries_current.txt`

## üéØ MLB-Specific Insights

### Why Home Advantage is Bigger:
1. **Park Dimensions:** Fenway (short left), Coors (high altitude), etc.
2. **162-Game Grind:** Travel fatigue matters more
3. **Last At-Bat:** Home team bats last (walkoff potential)
4. **Bullpen Familiarity:** Know when to warm up relievers
5. **Weather/Wind:** Know park-specific conditions

### Why Starting Pitcher Matters Most:
- Pitches ~6 innings (~60-65% of game)
- Controls BOTH runs scored AND runs allowed
- One injury changes entire game prediction
- **Impact: Starting pitcher injury = +4.0 points** (similar to QB)

### Why Streaks Matter More:
- 162 games = players get hot/cold
- Momentum is real over 10-game spans
- But season is long enough that regression happens
- Recent form weighted heavily (~70% vs ~65% in NFL)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations

### What's Tracked:
‚úÖ Team batting statistics (AVG, OBP, SLG, OPS, HR)
‚úÖ Team pitching (runs allowed, hits allowed)
‚úÖ Recent form (last 10 games)
‚úÖ Home/away splits
‚úÖ Injuries (position-weighted)
‚úÖ Run differential
‚úÖ Pythagorean expectation

### What's NOT Tracked:

### Priority Improvements:
1. **Starting pitcher tracking** (CRITICAL - would add +10% accuracy)
2. Bullpen quality metrics
3. Weather data
4. Park factors
5. Platoon splits
